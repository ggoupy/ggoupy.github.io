I am currently a research scientist at [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.nokia.com/bell-labs/), Espoo, Finland. I explore neuromorphic computing for wireless communication.

I obtained my PhD in computer science from University of Lille, France, in 2025. My research focused on efficient supervised learning in spiking neural networks.

Previously, I was a research intern in neuromorphic computing at [3IT](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/3it/en/), Sherbrooke, Canada.
