I am third-year PhD student in the [FoX](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/FOX/) team of the [CRIStAL](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/) laboratory, University of Lille, France.

Previously, I was a research intern at the [3IT](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/3it/en/), Sherbrooke, Canada.

## Research

My research focuses on Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), an area at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning.

Specifically, I study supervised training of SNNs based on Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP), a learning rule derived from synaptic plasticity observed in our brain. 
In addition, I explore how competition between neurons through Winner-Takes-All (WTA) can enhance the learning processes.
I apply my methods to computer vision tasks, such as object classification or action recognition. 

My long-term goal is to enable on-chip training of SNNs on neuromorphic hardware, which may significantly reduce the energy consumption of modern deep learning methods.

## Recent updates

- **[Nov. 2024]** I will be attending [NeurIPS 2024](https://neurips.cc/) in Vancouver, Canada, from December 10th to 15th. Excited to present my [latest work](https://ggoupy.github.io/publication/2024-ncg) in a poster session!"
