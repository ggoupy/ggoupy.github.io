[Paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2024.1401690) | [Code](https://gitlab.univ-lille.fr/fox/snn-pcn) | [Slides](https://ggoupy.github.io/files/slides-pcn-gdriasis23.pdf)

In this paper, we introduce:

1. Stabilized Supervised STDP (S2-STDP), a learning rule for training a spiking classification layer employing first-spike coding and single-spike integrate-and-fire neurons;

2. Paired Competing Neurons (PCN), an architecture based on intra-class winner-takes-all competition that promotes neuron specialization toward target or non-target samples.
